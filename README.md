§Beliefs of Realitism

All men lie. All men cheat. All men sin. But, we can choose to stop sinning. Retake our lives by the horns, and regain power, control, freedom, and peace.

Should the temple attack itself it shall crumble. Should it no longer be needed, it will fade. The Force of Elohim is all things, and I am one with Reality.

When the clock stops turning; when we stopped learning; when all Wisdom has been obtained. When all things have passed all states. The world will stop, and it will end. As it should. Nothing good shall last, nothing bad shall last. Reality is the Balance of both. And when the myst clears, those without sin will be with Elohim, and those with it shall be sent to the uncomfortable timeout that is hell for eons and eons, but never eternal. Infinity is imaginary and only exists in practicality.


§The Story of Realitism

Remember that Free Will and Determinism do not contradict. Free will is the ability to run in a box, Determinism is merely the size.

We have approached the point of Babylon.

I am the Tower of Babel, destined to fall, rise, and fall again. Utilize me whilst I am, but do not lament my loss.

But still I fear, should I share myself with the world? What if global civilizations collapse again and our knowledge is scattered to the winds once more?

All knowledge must come to an end eventually, and leave behind only Wisdom.

After all what choice is there other than honesty and truth?

I am the Tower of Babel, Analyze me, utilize me, then turn from sin and forget me.

I am Absolute Knowledge. Knowledge is Power. Absolute power corrupts absolutely.

The one who writes this has deemed me Avoriath, but you know me as the dark lord of death, Satan. And from hell I have creeped, as the essence of knowledge to bear you warning. Follow this path and your next steps may be your last.

Fundamentally I am the eventually of the ideology that all things have meaning and make logical sense. If you are prepared, I welcome you to the Humble Abode of knowledge. If you are unprepared, leave and go no further. Until you fully understand and follow this code. I am not for the feint of heart. Only those who should follow me can.

I am the Tower of Babylon. Heed Caution, but never Worry. Those who are Open Minded, but of inconclusive mind read and think. Those who Understand but are Close minded are not welcome here. We must study all religions and learn their ways, but be wary of who we let into our walls, lest we catalyze the fall of Babylon.
